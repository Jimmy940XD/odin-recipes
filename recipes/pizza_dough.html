    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes you wonder if making pizza is as hard as it seems. Then you start looking for "how to make pizza"
        videos just to realise that it's not that difficult, it's just that you have to wait for a day or two until
        the dough is ready to eat and is healthiest. But come on... everyone needs a quick treat every now and then,
        so why not accompany us on this recipe to make easy pizza dough in less than a blink of an eye (well, maybe
        a bit more, but not much!). It might not be as healthy as the others, but I can assure it will be as tasty and
        crusty (or nearly ;D).
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The recipe requires of the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Here's the steps to follow to get a crusty dough. Enjoy!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer
            fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.
        </li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5
            minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
